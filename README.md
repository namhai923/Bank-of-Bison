# Bison Bank of Canada (BBC) Project Proposal

## Vision

Let's face it, life was so much simpler when we were kids. But when your an adult and you have responsibilites, such as kids, work and software engineering projects, life gets much more hectic. So why would anyone want their banking to be hard also. We all used to be software developers for BBC news with a busy work schedule, and when we got home and had to try banking with the RBC app (eww), you can understand why we went crazy and had to leave immediately. That is why we made Bison Bank of Canada (BBC) - a banking app so simple and intuitive that no more unneeded stress needs to be added to your life! 

Transfer money in seconds! Track your expenses with ease! Scotiabank sucks! Join us now!

## Summary

Bison Bank of Canada (BBC) is a banking web application that runs on any browser. It has a user interface that will allow users to track their past expenses, add and transfer money between different accounts. A retailer, using a special interface, can charge a user of BBC for a specific purchase which will reflect on the user’s bank account under the expenses. 

A vital feature that our app provides is transferring money between accounts. Two different accounts should be able to transfer money between accounts as long as they have each other’s account numbers. It is as simple as entering the bank account number, and the amount in the user interface provided for transferring the money and clicking the submit button. For security reasons, our app lets the sender of the money know the receiver's name after they enter their bank account number.

Before taking advantage of any of the aforementioned features, users must add money to their bank account. Adding money to a bank account cannot be simpler. A user simply adds the desired amount of money to their bank account through the user interface, which will automatically update their record. 

With more teenagers entering adulthood and living independently, BBC is the best place to start their journey into learning the basics of banking. Our team aspires to improve this app in the future. We shall add security features like users requiring authentication before sending or receiving money. Furthermore, our team would like to improve the retailer’s user interface - it will help improve the user’s past expense interface in the main UI.

## Core features
#### 1. Tracking user's expense
After signing in, a webpage interface will show up the signed-in account remaining balance and show the past expense record so that account owners can keep track of their spending.

#### 2. Transferring money between accounts 
After signing in, the web interface will have an option for people to transfer their money to a different account

#### 3. Sending transaction records to the system

The server will have a way to accept transaction records and update related account balances based on the information stored in the records.

#### 4. Non Functional Feature: Server should be able to handle heavy load from both user and incoming transaction

The server can handle more than 500 users usage at the same time or 500 transaction records within 1 minute

## Technologies

MERN tech stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) with GitHub Actions and Docker
